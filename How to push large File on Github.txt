🚀 How to Push Large Files to GitHub Using Git LFS
1. Install Git LFS

Download and install from:
https://git-lfs.com/

Then run:

git lfs install

2. Tell Git LFS to track large file types

For example, to track all .mp4 files:

git lfs track "*.mp4"


This creates a .gitattributes file.

3. Add files
git add .

4. Commit changes
git commit -m "Enable Git LFS for videos"

5. Push to GitHub
git push

🔥 Important Notes (Add these to your document)
✔️ If large files were committed earlier → Git will reject the push

You must clean the commit history or delete the big files first.

✔️ Git LFS only works when the files are added after enabling LFS

It does NOT automatically fix old commits.

✔️ GitHub Desktop works fine with Git LFS

No extra setup needed.
